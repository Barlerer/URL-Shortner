# URL Shortner
This is a TypeScript URL Shortner üåè.
This is a pet project which I have learned the use of:
* TypeORM - ORM system management
* TypeScript - How to use, write and compile it. Also the folder structure.
* Docker-compose and its easy benefits for deployment.
* Jest - Testing framework and API testing.

## How to use it?
Clone this repo and run `docker-compose up`.

## Is there a live example of this?
Will do.

## Can I run this without docker?
Yes, run 
```
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```
Please note if you run it without docker you will need a Postgres server.

## Can I suggest anything?
Please do, <barlerer@gmail.com>
